# Compiled TypeScript files (if not part of a 'dist' directory)
# Generally, you commit your .ts files and not the compiled .js, .d.ts files
# unless you are publishing a library to npm.
# If your build process puts compiled JS/TS in the same directory as source,
# uncomment these and adjust as necessary.

# Prisma generated clients (if you use Prisma, these are generated in node_modules or a specific location)

# For example, if it's in `src/generated/`
# src/generated/

# If you have any temporary files created by your application
# e.g., uploaded files for processing that are not meant to be kept in the repo
